excerpt: 'This paper is the first one to develop structured input-output analysis to analyze transitional wall-bounded shear flows. It employs a structured singular value approach to capture the componentwise structures of nonlinearity, which weakens the lift-up effect and identify streamwise varying structures close to direct numerical simulations, experiments and nonlinear optimal perturbations'

This paper is the first one to develop structured input-output analysis to analyze transitional wall-bounded shear flows. It employs a structured singular value approach to capture the componentwise structures of nonlinearity, which weakens the lift-up effect and identify streamwise varying structures close to direct numerical simulations, experiments and nonlinear optimal perturbations
