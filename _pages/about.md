Welcome to Chang Liu's website. 

I am currently working as a postdoc with [Edgar Knobloch](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/edgar-knobloch) at University of California, Berkeley, Department of Physics. The collaborators of my postdoc work include [Keith Julien](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/keith-julien-0) and [Manjul Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=O0spKioAAAAJ).

My Ph.D. research is done with [Dennice F. Gayme](https://engineering.jhu.edu/gayme/) in Johns Hopkins University, Department of Mechanical Engineering. The collaborators of my Ph.D. work include [Colm-cille P. Caulfield](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/cpc12), [Stanislav Gordeyev](https://aero-optics.nd.edu/people/members/stanislav-gordeyev/), [Flint Thomas](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/flint-thomas/), [Igal Gluzman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f8mjPWIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Samaresh Midya](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yErZKGUAAAAJ&hl=en), [Mitchell Lozier](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YOEWO7QAAAAJ&hl=en). Some of my Ph.D. work is further extended in collaboration with [Aishwarya Rath](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I8_grjYAAAAJ&hl=en) and Yu Shuai.

My undergraduate research is done with [Shixiao Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ROYLltsAAAAJ&hl=en) in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The collaborators include [Mengmeng Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W8B0eloAAAAJ&hl=en), [Haojie Ren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Su2DFawAAAAJ&hl=en), [Yuwang Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VSzjUgcAAAAJ&hl=en)

My research work lies in an intersection between fluid dynamics, nonlinear dynamical system, optimization and control theory.

My main research interest is understanding fluid dynamics using a wide range of tools including nonlinear dynamical system, control theory, optimization, adaptive filtering, asymptotic analysis, semi-analytical solution and direct numerical simulations. 

My interested topic in fluid dynamics include double-diffusive convection, wall-bounded shear flows, stratified shear flows, shallow water waves and vortex-induced vibrations.

The keywords of my research can be summarized as figure below
