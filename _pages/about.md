We have two Ph.D. positions opening! Please contact chang_liu@uconn.edu if you are interested in working with us. 

FLuids, Uncertainty, Estimation, Nonlinearity and Turbulence (FLUENT) Lab is led by Prof. Chang Liu at Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Connecticut. We work on the intersection among fluid dynamics, nonlinear dynamical system, control theory, state estimation and optimization with a special focus on turbulence. 

I am currently working as a postdoc with [Edgar Knobloch](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/edgar-knobloch) at University of California, Berkeley, Department of Physics. The collaborators of my postdoc work include [Keith Julien](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/keith-julien-0) and [Manjul Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=O0spKioAAAAJ).

My main research tools employed to understand fluid dynamics include bifurcation analysis, robust control theory, semi-definite optimization, adaptive filtering, asymptotic analysis and direct numerical simulations.

My current interested topic in fluid dynamics include double-diffusive convection, wall-bounded shear flows, stratified shear flows, shallow water waves and vortex-induced vibrations.

These can be summarized by figure below
