Welcome to Chang Liu's website. 

My research work lies in an interaction between fluid dynamics, nonlinear dynamical system, optimization and control theory.

My main research interest is understanding fluid dynamics using a wide range of tools including nonlinear dynamical system, asymptotic analysis, control theory, optimization and direct numerical simulations. 

My interested topic in fluid dynamics include double-diffusive convection, wall-bounded shear flows, stratified shear flows, shallow water waves and vortex-induced vibrations.

The keywords of my research can be summarized as figure below
