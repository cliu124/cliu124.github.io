We have two Ph.D. positions opening! Please contact chang_liu@uconn.edu if you are interested in working with us. 

FLuids, Uncertainty, Estimation, Nonlinearity and Turbulence (FLUENT) Lab is led by Prof. Chang Liu at Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Connecticut. We work on the intersection of the intersection among fluid dynamics, nonlinear dynamical system, control theory, state estimation and optimization with a special focus on hydrodynamic turbulence. 

I am currently working as a postdoc with [Edgar Knobloch](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/edgar-knobloch) at University of California, Berkeley, Department of Physics. The collaborators of my postdoc work include [Keith Julien](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/keith-julien-0) and [Manjul Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=O0spKioAAAAJ).

My Ph.D. research is done with [Dennice F. Gayme](https://engineering.jhu.edu/gayme/) in Johns Hopkins University, Department of Mechanical Engineering. The collaborators of my Ph.D. work include [Colm-cille P. Caulfield](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/cpc12), [Stanislav Gordeyev](https://aero-optics.nd.edu/people/members/stanislav-gordeyev/), [Flint Thomas](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/flint-thomas/), [Igal Gluzman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f8mjPWIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Samaresh Midya](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yErZKGUAAAAJ&hl=en), [Mitchell Lozier](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YOEWO7QAAAAJ&hl=en). Some of my Ph.D. work is further extended in collaboration with [Aishwarya Rath](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I8_grjYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yu Shuai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5gI4G0kAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also fortunate to work with [Antwan D. Clark](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Antwan-Clark) in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics. 

My undergraduate research is done with [Shixiao Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ROYLltsAAAAJ&hl=en) in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The collaborators include [Mengmeng Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W8B0eloAAAAJ&hl=en), [Haojie Ren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Su2DFawAAAAJ&hl=en), [Yuwang Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VSzjUgcAAAAJ&hl=en)

My research work lies in an intersection between fluid dynamics, nonlinear dynamical system, control theory and optimization.

The keywords of my research can be summarized as figure below

My main research tools employed to understand fluid dynamics include bifurcation analysis, robust control theory, semi-definite optimization, adaptive filtering, asymptotic analysis and direct numerical simulations.

My current interested topic in fluid dynamics include double-diffusive convection, wall-bounded shear flows, stratified shear flows, shallow water waves and vortex-induced vibrations.

These can be summarized by figure below
