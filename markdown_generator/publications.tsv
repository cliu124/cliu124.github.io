2021-11-25	Structured input-output analysis of transitional wall-bounded flows	Journal of Fluid Mechanics	"This paper is the first one to develop structured input-output analysis to analyze transitional wall-bounded shear flows. It employs a structured singular value approach to capture the componentwise structures of nonlinearity, which weakens the lift-up effect and identify streamwise varying structures close to direct numerical simulations, experiments and nonlinear optimal perturbations"	"Liu C., Gayme D.F.
